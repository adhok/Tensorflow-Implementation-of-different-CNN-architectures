# Tensorflow-Implementation-of-different-CNN-architectures
Implementation using the book  "Hands on Machine Learning with Sci-Kit Learn Keras and Tensorflow" as a guide


**The following architectures are implemented**  


* GoogLeNet Architecture

* AlexNet architecture

* LeNet 5 architecture

* ResNet - 34 architecture

* ResNet - 50 architecture

* ResNet - 152 architecture

* VGGNet based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf ; In this repository I have implemented 16(C & D) layered and 19(E) layered version of the network.
